# LOBAS

This is a standalone script written in Powershell for [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/).
You can search for windows executables that can be exploited to bypass system security restrictions.
These binaries can be abused to break out of restricted shells, escalate privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, etc...

The functions are from [https://lolbas-project.github.io/](https://lolbas-project.github.io/) and all credit goes to its respective contributors.
They are simplified (no need for environmental variables) and syntax highlighted.
